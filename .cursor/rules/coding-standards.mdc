# Healthcare IT Coding Standards

## Code Quality Principles

- **Production-Ready**: Write code as if it's going to production immediately
- **Healthcare Focus**: Prioritize accuracy, reliability, and user experience for hospital staff
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easily maintainable by hospital IT teams
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive documentation for healthcare workflows
- **Testing**: Thorough testing for healthcare scenarios and edge cases

## Python Standards (Backend)

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines with healthcare-specific naming
- Implement comprehensive error handling for medical workflows
- Use async/await for I/O operations (database, API calls)
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use environment variables for configuration

## JavaScript Standards (Frontend)

- Use vanilla JavaScript for maximum hospital system compatibility
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use async/await for API calls with loading states
- Follow consistent naming conventions for healthcare contexts
- Include comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Validate all user inputs thoroughly

## Database Standards

- Use descriptive table and column names for healthcare data
- Implement proper foreign key constraints and cascading
- Use appropriate data types for medical information
- Include audit trails for all data changes
- Implement proper indexing for healthcare queries
- Use transactions for data integrity

## API Design Standards

- Use RESTful conventions for hospital system integration
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Use FastAPI's automatic validation and documentation
- Include comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Implement rate limiting for healthcare API usage
- Use proper authentication and authorization

## Security Standards

- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper session management
- Log access for healthcare compliance requirements
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Healthcare IT Specific

- Use clear, medical terminology in code comments
- Implement proper data privacy for patient information
- Include comprehensive error messages for hospital IT teams
- Test thoroughly with healthcare workflow scenarios
- Ensure backward compatibility for hospital system updates
- Document all healthcare-specific business logic

## Performance Standards

- Optimize for hospital network constraints
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use efficient database queries for healthcare data
- Monitor performance in hospital environments
- Implement proper resource management
- Test with realistic healthcare data volumes
